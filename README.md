- 2D Design: A simple and enjoyable game with 2D design reminiscent of classic arcade games.

## Important Notes:

- Jump: SpaceBar

## About the Game:

To increase difficulty, I added a "False Jump" mechanism: After the third jump, the player will experience a "False Jump," and they must land on the ground and press Space to cancel the "False Jump." Only then will the player regain the ability to jump twice again.

## Responsiveness:

The game is designed for desktop play since it uses keyboard event listeners. Therefore, it is optimized for screen sizes above 1050px by 750px.
